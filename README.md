# Phase 1: Flutter Visual Builder Foundation

## Overview
Phase 1 establishes the core foundation for the Flutter Visual Builder system, including user management, project management, and a basic component library.

## What's Implemented

### 1. **Flutter Project Management**
- Create, read, update, and delete Flutter projects
- Project configuration (name, package name, colors, languages)
- Project duplication functionality
- User-specific project isolation

### 2. **Component Templates**
- Pre-defined Flutter widget templates
- Categories: Layout, Input, Display, Navigation, Feedback
- Component properties and constraints
- Management command to seed initial components

### 3. **Screen Management**
- Create screens for Flutter projects
- Define routes and home screen
- Store UI structure as JSON
- Screen duplication functionality

### 4. **API Endpoints**

#### Projects
- `GET /api/projects/flutter-projects/` - List user's projects
- `POST /api/projects/flutter-projects/` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/flutter-projects/{id}/` - Get project details
- `PUT/PATCH /api/projects/flutter-projects/{id}/` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/flutter-projects/{id}/` - Delete project
- `POST /api/projects/flutter-projects/{id}/duplicate/` - Duplicate project

#### Component Templates
- `GET /api/projects/component-templates/` - List all templates
- `GET /api/projects/component-templates/by_category/` - Get templates by category

#### Screens
- `GET /api/projects/screens/` - List screens (filter by project)
- `POST /api/projects/screens/` - Create new screen
- `GET /api/projects/screens/{id}/` - Get screen details
- `PUT/PATCH /api/projects/screens/{id}/` - Update screen
- `DELETE /api/projects/screens/{id}/` - Delete screen
- `POST /api/projects/screens/{id}/set_as_home/` - Set as home screen
- `POST /api/projects/screens/{id}/duplicate/` - Duplicate screen

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run Initial Commands**
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp projects
   python manage.py startapp builder
   python manage.py startapp builds
   ```

2. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations projects builder builds
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Load Initial Data**
   ```bash
   python manage.py create_component_templates
   ```

4. **Test the Implementation**
   ```bash
   python test_phase1.py
   ```

## Key Models

### FlutterProject
- Stores Flutter project information
- Links to user (owner)
- Supports multiple languages
- Configurable colors and metadata

### ComponentTemplate
- Pre-defined Flutter widgets
- Categorized for easy discovery
- Default properties for each widget
- Constraints (can have children, max children)

### Screen
- Belongs to a Flutter project
- Has a route and name
- Stores UI structure as JSON
- One screen must be marked as home

## Notes

- The `is_developer` flag is ignored in Phase 1 as requested
- All authenticated users can create Flutter projects
- The system is designed to be extended in future phases
- Component templates are seeded via management command

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will add:
- Visual builder backend with widget mapping
- Code generation for Flutter widgets
- Property mapping system
- More complex UI structures

## Testing

The `test_phase1.py` script validates:
- User registration and authentication
- Project creation and management
- Component template loading
- Screen creation with UI structure
- Project duplication

Run the test script to ensure everything is working correctly before proceeding to Phase 2.
